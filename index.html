            <h2>Map of global terrorist attacks</h2>
            <p>The map on the right-hand side displays the number of fatalities in each country relative to one and other. It is immediately clear that, although lives are being lost to terrorism in each region, some regions are more affected than others. For example, at least in regards to terrorism, the lost of human life is relatively low in both South Africa, Australia and Europe, whereas, it is considerable in both North America and Central Asia, with it being the highest in South Asia and Northern Africa. Particular hotspots become immediately clear, these hotspots include Afrghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Iraq (all with deaths in the 10's of thousands). </p>

            <h2>Line graph of global terrorist attacks with at least 100 deaths</h2>
            <p>This visualisation aims to convey the direct loss of human life over time between different countries. Some interesting information that can be immediately seen, include the fact that although the United States lost nearly 1400 lives in 2001 (which coincides with 9/11), this was a singular peak with no such rise/fall afterwards. This is in stark contrast to the other countries present, some of which have deaths in the hundreds for multiple years (indicating a consistent struggle against terrorism). These countries include Somalia, Iraq and Syria. Another interesting thing to note about this visualisation is that, it is extremely useful in conveying how countries deal with terrorism and the conditions of countries at different periods of time (Iraq in 2014 peaked, coinciding with the rise of ISIS, similarly, Somalia's increasingly deteriorating stability can be seen by the rise between 2016 and 2017</p>

            <h2>Stacked area chart of global terrorist attacks for each country (with deaths over 100)</h2>
            <p>This is an extremely interesting visualisation, as, compared to the other visualisations that we have seen, this visualisation does a fantastic job of conveying periods of global termoil in the fight against terrorism. For example, we can see two peaks in this visualisation that are far more apparent than all others, these peaks are in 2001 and 2014 respectively. Both these dates are extremely significant, as, 2001 represents 9/11 (with the largest share of deaths being those from the United States), whereas, 2014 represents deteriorating conditions in the Middle East in addition to the rise of ISIS (with the vast majority of countries in this period being in the Middle East/Africa). </p>

            <h2>Area chart of global terrorist attacks summed</h2>
            <p>Unlike the previous chart which aimed to convey the relative relationship between countries and the number of people killed in terrorist attacks, this visualisation aims to show the trend of terrorism and the number of lives lost globally. It is immediately clear that, the number of lives lost between 2000 and 2017 is increasing, with the peak in 2014 being multiple magnitudes larger than the that of 2000. Unfortunately, it seems that, at least in terms of the number of people killed, terrorism is rising globally rather than deteriorating.</p>

            <h2>Number of terrorist related deaths in individual countries</h2>
            <p>This visualisation allows the user to select a country and view the number of deaths over time for that specific country. It is extremely insightful, especially given how strongly the number of deaths can represent the condition of the country at the time. An example of this can be seen with Iraq, where between 2003 and 2007 it is consistently rising (which strongly coincides with the Iraq war which ran between 2003 and 2011), additionally, we see peaks in 2014 which also conincide with ISIS taking over the city of Mosul in Iraq (resulting in many casualties).</p>
